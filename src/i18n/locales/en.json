    "frontendIntro": "Frontend development is where technology and experience come together. I focus on pixel-perfect components, consistent code (using Prettier and ESLint), and a good balance between reusability and readability. Working with Vue (and Nuxt), TypeScript, and Tailwind helps me achieve my goals for end users, and I thrive on creating clear, scalable interfaces that just work—both technically and visually.",
    "backendIntro": "Backend development is all about structure, logic, and smart connections. Whether it's a WordPress setup as a headless CMS, building custom APIs, or integrating third-party systems, I enjoy thinking about architecture and love solutions that are maintainable in the long run. My experience with PHP, Laravel, custom plugin development, and API design helps me give the frontend—and thus the end user—exactly what it needs.",
